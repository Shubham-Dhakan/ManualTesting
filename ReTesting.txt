What is Re-Testing?
---------------------------->
Testing conducted on the fixed bug by developer is called as Re-Testing. 
Tester closes the bug and if re-opens tester sends the bug to developer. 

Example:
----------> 
- Build 1.0 was released. Test team found some defects (Defect id 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and posted 
- Build 1.1 was released, now testing id 1.0.1, 1.0.2 is retesting
