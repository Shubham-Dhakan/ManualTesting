Example of Re-Testing vs Regression Testing: 
-------------------------------------------------> 
An application Under Test has three modules namely:

Admin
Purchase 
Finance (It is dependent on Purchase Module)

If a tester finds bug in purchase module and reports it,
dev fixes the bug and now tester will test that bug and module (Re-Test Example)

But also finance is dependent on purchase module so we have to test that module too (Regional Regression Testing)

So the GOLD tip is to perform Full Regression Testing in this kind of Situation.
