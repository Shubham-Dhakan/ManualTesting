What is Regressio Testing?
------------------------------------> 
When Developer has build one module and tester is testing it further ahead bug is reported. 
Now tester will report bug to developer, developer will work on that module and try to debug that module. 

Now developer will create new module for same feature with and maybe with new updates. 
So the new module created should not affect the previous module and that testing is known as regression testing.

Testing Conducted on modified builds to make sure there will not be impact on exisiting functionality because of changes like 
adding/deleting/modifying features. 

#3 Types of regression testing: 
---------------------------------------->
Unit testing:
Testing only the modifications/changes done by developer.

Regional Regression Testing:
Testing the modified module along with impacted modules. 
Impact Analysis meeting conducts to identify impacted modules with QA and Dev

Full Regression: ) MOST PREFERRED ( 
Reason: When bug is reported and fixed than mostly developer has changed entire code so to test the entire module of app is better choice. 
Testing main feature and remaining module of the application 
Eg: Dev has created many modules, instead of identifying impacted modules, 
we perform one round of testing.
